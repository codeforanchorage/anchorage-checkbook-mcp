# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (uv preferred, pip fallback)
uv sync                              # or: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run local MCP server (no Lambda needed)
python3 scripts/local_server.py      # Serves on http://localhost:8000/mcp
# The only local entry point. It routes through UniversalHTTPHandler, the
# same handler the Lambda adapter uses, so Origin/protocol-version/path
# checks behave locally exactly as they do in prod.

# Validate config
python3 -c "from core.validators import load_and_validate_config; load_and_validate_config('config.yaml')"

# Tests
uv run pytest tests/ -n auto                                    # All tests, parallel
uv run pytest tests/test_ckan_plugin.py -v                      # Single file
uv run pytest tests/test_ckan_plugin.py::TestClass::test_name -v  # Single test
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=core --cov=plugins --cov-report=term-missing  # With coverage (80% minimum)

# Linting (ruff)
uv run ruff check core/ plugins/ server/ tests/      # Check
uv run ruff check core/ plugins/ server/ tests/ --fix # Auto-fix
uv run ruff format core/ plugins/ server/ tests/      # Format

# Pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Go client (requires Go 1.21+)
cd client && make build

# Deploy to AWS
./scripts/deploy.sh --environment staging
```

## Architecture

**Core rule: One Fork = One MCP Server.** Each deployment runs exactly ONE plugin. This is enforced at config validation time (`core/validators.py`) and at runtime (`PluginManager.load_plugins()`). To deploy multiple MCP servers, fork the repo per plugin.

**Request flow:**
```
Claude (stdio) → Go client (client/) or stdio_bridge.py → HTTP POST /mcp
  → Lambda (server/adapters/aws_lambda.py) or scripts/local_server.py
  → server/http_handler.py → core/mcp_server.py (JSON-RPC 2.0)
  → core/plugin_manager.py → Plugin → External API
```

**Key modules:**
- `core/interfaces.py` — Abstract bases: `MCPPlugin`, `DataPlugin`, plus `ToolDefinition`, `ToolResult`, `PluginType` enum
- `core/plugin_manager.py` — Discovers plugins by scanning `plugins/` and `custom_plugins/` for `plugin.py` files. Registers tools with `pluginname__toolname` prefix. Routes `tools/call` to the correct plugin.
- `core/mcp_server.py` — Handles MCP JSON-RPC methods: `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `ping`
- `core/validators.py` — Loads config from `config.yaml` (local) or `OPENCONTEXT_CONFIG` env var (Lambda). Enforces single-plugin rule.
- `server/adapters/aws_lambda.py` — the AWS Lambda entry point (handler: `server.adapters.aws_lambda.lambda_handler`), and the only one. It is a thin adapter onto `UniversalHTTPHandler`; `scripts/local_server.py` is the aiohttp mirror of it.
- `server/http_handler.py` — Cloud-agnostic HTTP handler shared by Lambda and local server
- `stdio_bridge.py` — Python stdio-to-HTTP bridge for connecting Claude Desktop/Code to the local server (alternative to Go client)

**Built-in plugins** (`plugins/`): `ckan`, `arcgis`, `socrata` — each implements `DataPlugin` with `search_datasets`, `get_dataset`, `query_data`. Custom plugins go in `custom_plugins/` and are auto-discovered.

## Plugin Development

New plugins must implement `MCPPlugin` (or `DataPlugin` for data sources). Place in `custom_plugins/<name>/plugin.py`. The class must define `plugin_name`, `plugin_type`, `plugin_version` and implement `initialize()`, `shutdown()`, `get_tools()`, `execute_tool()`, `health_check()`. Tool names are auto-prefixed — return bare names from `get_tools()`.

## Configuration

Copy `config-anchorage-checkbook.yaml` to `config.yaml` (this fork ships its config ready to go). Enable exactly one plugin. Config supports `${ENV_VAR}` substitution. For Lambda, `config.yaml` is shipped *inside* the deployment package and read at runtime by `server/http_handler.py::_packaged_config_path` — not via the `OPENCONTEXT_CONFIG` env var, which AWS caps at 4KB.

`config.yaml` is gitignored; `config-anchorage-checkbook.yaml` is the tracked source of truth and the two must stay byte-identical (pinned by `tests/test_deployment_config.py`). deploy.sh packages `config.yaml`, so a fix applied to only one of them ships half-applied.

Two AWS sizing values are read from `config.yaml` in preference to `terraform/aws/<env>.tfvars` — `lambda_memory` and `lambda_timeout` (see the `locals` block in `terraform/aws/main.tf`). Editing them in the tfvars alone silently does nothing, and because one config file feeds both environments, a value set there applies to staging *and* prod. `lambda_name` uses the opposite precedence — the tfvars win — so `aws.lambda_name` in config.yaml does NOT decide which environment a deploy targets; `./scripts/deploy.sh -e staging|prod` does, by selecting the tfvars file and the Terraform workspace. Check `main.tf` per variable rather than assuming.

**`terraform/aws/config.yaml` is a BUILD ARTIFACT, not a source file.** `scripts/deploy.sh` copies the repo-root `config.yaml` over it during packaging, and it is gitignored. Two consequences: edits made directly to it vanish on the next deploy, and a bare `terraform plan` run inside `terraform/aws/` (without the packaging steps) reads the STALE copy — so a config change shows up as nothing but a code-hash diff, and a "timeout fix" can appear to apply while changing nothing. Always go through `./scripts/deploy.sh -e <env>`, which repackages before planning.

**Timeout ladder** — each layer must sit under the one above it:

| Layer | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| API Gateway integration | 29s | hard REST limit, not adjustable |
| Lambda (`lambda_timeout`) | 28s | self-terminates before the gateway gives up |
| Plugin HTTP (`plugins.anchorage_checkbook.timeout`) | 20s | a hung upstream returns a readable tool error instead of the Lambda being killed mid-flight |

## CI

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff lint/format, pip-audit, pytest with coverage, and Go tests on push to main/develop and on PRs.
